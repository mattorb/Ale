Prioritized:
* watcher/thumb style (daemon that runs a command when a test or filespec changes)

Not prioritized yet:
* way to tag commands into categories/qualities (experimental, testing, etc)
* when the api and structure stabilizes:
  * test the heck out of thyself
  * flush out the 'how to contribute' stuff and the basic readme
* local and remote console
* MD5 check downloads
* resolve namespace/multicommand ambiguity issues (installing 'test' installs test+coverage)
* non-osx compatibility?
* NOSE GAE?
* use docstrings for help text
* jslint runner
* test makers/http recording tools
* dump/restore shortcuts for datastore

random ideas:
* dash to jump to an apps dashboard?
* logs to jump to an apps logs?
* gae doc for the app engine docs
* eclipse init to set up a pydev project
* downorup -- ping homepage on interval to check availability
