Prioritized:
* tidy destroys a file it has a syntax error parse it...  check with pyflakes first? or tidy to stdout and check return code?
* watcher/thumb style (daemon that runs a command when a filespec changes changes)

not prioritized yet:
* when the api and structure stabilizes:
  * test the heck out of thyself
  * flush out the 'how to contribute' stuff and the basic readme
* local and remote console
* MD5 check downloads
* resolve namespace/multicommand ambiguity issues (installing 'test' installs test+coverage)
* non-osx compatibility
* NOSE GAE?
* use docstrings for help text
* jslint runner
* test makers/http recording tools
* dump/restore shortcuts for datastore

random ideas:
* dash to jump to an apps dashboard?
* logs to jump to an apps logs?
* gae doc for the app engine docs
* eclipse init to set up a pydev project
