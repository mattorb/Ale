Not prioritized yet:
* add pep8 command - http://github.com/jcrocholl/pep8/raw/49fb01f94e27242c5604bbc3cb04ab7e8a593e34/pep8.py
* when the api and structure stabilizes:
  * test the heck out of thyself
  * flush out the 'how to contribute' stuff and the basic readme
* local and remote console
* MD5 check downloads
* resolve namespace/multicommand ambiguity issues (installing 'test' installs test+coverage)
* non-osx compatibility?
* NOSE GAE?
* use docstrings for help text
* jslint runner
* test makers/http recording tools
* dump/restore shortcuts for datastore
* local and remote shell

random ideas:
* dash to jump to an apps dashboard?
* logs to jump to an apps logs?
* gae doc for the app engine docs
* eclipse init to set up a pydev project
* downorup -- ping homepage on interval to check availability
* media compressor/bundler
