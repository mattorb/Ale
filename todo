Not prioritized yet:
* add pep8 command - http://github.com/jcrocholl/pep8/raw/49fb01f94e27242c5604bbc3cb04ab7e8a593e34/pep8.py
* when the api and structure stabilizes:
  * test the heck out of thyself
* local and remote console
* MD5 check downloads
* resolve namespace/multicommand ambiguity issues (installing 'test' installs test+coverage)
* non-osx compatibility?
* NOSE GAE? -- sandbox / test feature
* use docstrings for help text
* test makers/http recording tools
* dump/restore shortcuts for datastore
* local and remote shell
* more sophisticated test re-runner for watch -- modipyd??
* generate smoke test with hello world apps?
* pale stuff
* on failure you get errorlevels adding together instead of number of failures (256 errors = a 256 return code usually)

random ideas:
* dash to jump to an apps dashboard?
* logs to jump to an apps logs?
* gae doc for the app engine docs
* eclipse init to set up a pydev project
* downorup -- ping homepage on interval to check availability
* media compressor/bundler
